# ES Lab Final Project : Smart Parking Project

## Concept and Motivation

Driving in Taipei is an integral part of daily life but often comes with its own set of challenges and dangers. To address this, our project aims to design a smart driving assistance system. The goal is to provide real-time alerts about the direction and distance of surrounding objects, offer instructions and help for making safe navigational decisions, and present information in an intuitive visual format to enhance safety on the roads.

## Main Functionalities

Our project focuses on several key functionalities to achieve this goal:

- **Realtime Measurement**: Measure and display distance, acceleration, and angular data in real-time.
- **Driving Mode**: Switch between Normal Driving and Parking Mode for different driving scenarios.
- **Danger Detection**: Provide warning messages and control brakes to prevent potential hazards.
- **Screen Display**: Show First Person View (FPV) scenes, current mode, and messages on a screen for easy understanding.
- **Auto Parking**: Implement machine learning algorithms for an efficient auto parking system.

## Hardware Setup

The robot's hardware is based on the PiRacer Pro, a versatile and powerful robot car designed for Raspberry Pi. 

I followed the detailed instructions in the *PiRacer Pro AI Kit Assembly Tutorial* PDF provided by Waveshare to assemble the robot. This document is a valuable resource for anyone setting up their PiRacer Pro, covering everything from assembly to initial hardware testing.
